"""
Module that validates the flight school's records.

This is the primary module that does all of the work. It loads the files, loops through
the lessons, and searches for any takeoffs that violate insurance requirements.

Technically, we could have put many of these functions in __main__.py.  That is the
main module of this application anyway.  However, for testing purposes we want all
functions in modules and we only want script code in the file __main__.py

    Searches the dataset directory for any flight lessons the violation regulations.
    
    This function will call list_weather_violations() to get the list of weather violations.
    If list_endorsment_violations (optional) is completed, it will call that too, as
    well as list_inspection_violations.  It will concatenate all of these 2d lists
    into a single 2d list of violations (so a flight may be listed more than once for
    each of the three types of violations).
    
    If the parameter output is not None, it will create the CSV file with name output
    and write the 2d list of violations to this file.  This CSV file should have the
    following header:
    
        STUDENT,AIRPLANE,INSTRUCTOR,TAKEOFF,LANDING,FILED,AREA,REASON
    
    Regardless of whether output is None, this function will print out the number of
    violations, as follows:
    
        '23 violations found.'
    
    If no violations are found, it will say
    
        'No violations found.'
